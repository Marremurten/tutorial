# Footer Component - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** December 8, 2024  
**Feature Branch:** `feature/footer`

## Overview

Create a simple, clean footer component for the Stockholm Places application that provides basic navigation links and copyright information with a professional appearance.

## User Stories

**As a user, I want to:**
- See navigation links at the bottom of every page for easy access
- Have quick access to Home, About, and Contact pages
- See proper copyright information for the site
- Have a consistent footer experience across all pages

**As a developer, I want to:**
- A reusable footer component that works across the application
- Clean, maintainable code that follows project conventions
- Proper TypeScript support and responsive design

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Navigation Links**
   - Home link that navigates to the main page (/)
   - About link that navigates to an about page (/about)
   - Contact link that navigates to a contact page (/contact)
   - All links should be functional and navigate to actual pages

2. **Copyright Information**
   - Display copyright text with customizable company name
   - Format: "� 2024 [Company Name]. All rights reserved."
   - Year should be dynamic (current year)

3. **Layout & Positioning**
   - Left-aligned layout with links and copyright on the same line
   - Links positioned on the left side
   - Copyright text positioned on the right side
   - Footer appears at the bottom of content (not fixed/sticky)

### Technical Requirements

1. **Component Structure**
   - Create `Footer.tsx` component in `src/components/`
   - Use Next.js Link component for navigation
   - Follow existing project TypeScript patterns
   - Include proper props interface for customizable company name

2. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
   - Ensure responsive design (stack on mobile if needed)
   - Match existing application color scheme
   - Clean, professional appearance with proper spacing

3. **Integration**
   - Add footer to root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - Ensure footer appears on all pages consistently
   - No interference with existing page content

### Design Specifications

**Desktop Layout:**
```
[Home] [About] [Contact]                    � 2024 Company Name. All rights reserved.
```

**Styling Guidelines:**
- Background: Light gray or white
- Text color: Dark gray for good contrast
- Link hover effects: Subtle color change or underline
- Padding: Adequate spacing around content
- Border: Optional subtle top border

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile: Stack links above copyright if needed
- Maintain readability across all screen sizes

## Implementation Plan (Test-Driven Development)

### Phase 1: Test Setup & Red Phase
1. Create `Footer.test.tsx` in `src/components/__tests__/`
2. Write failing tests for all required functionality:
   - Component renders without errors
   - Displays all navigation links (Home, About, Contact)
   - Shows copyright with current year
   - Links have correct href attributes
   - Handles custom company name prop
   - Responsive layout classes are applied
3. Run tests to confirm they fail (Red phase)

### Phase 2: Green Phase - Make Tests Pass
1. Create minimal `Footer.tsx` component to pass tests
2. Implement navigation links using Next.js Link
3. Add dynamic copyright year functionality
4. Implement company name prop with default value
5. Add basic Tailwind CSS classes for layout
6. Run tests until all pass (Green phase)

### Phase 3: Refactor Phase
1. Optimize component structure and readability
2. Improve CSS styling and responsive design
3. Add hover effects and transitions
4. Ensure code follows project conventions
5. Run tests to ensure no regressions

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
1. Create placeholder About and Contact pages
2. Add Footer to root layout
3. Write integration tests for navigation
4. Test across different screen sizes

## Success Criteria

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] All unit tests pass (minimum 15 tests covering all functionality)
- [ ] Test coverage is above 90% for Footer component
- [ ] Integration tests confirm navigation works end-to-end
- [ ] Tests verify responsive behavior

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Footer component renders on all pages
- [ ] All navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Copyright displays current year dynamically
- [ ] Layout is responsive and looks good on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and TypeScript standards
- [ ] No visual or functional regressions on existing pages

### TDD Process Validation
- [ ] Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed for each feature
- [ ] Tests written before implementation
- [ ] Component developed incrementally based on failing tests

## Technical Notes

**File Structure:**
```
src/
  components/
    Footer.tsx
    __tests__/
      Footer.test.tsx
  app/
    about/
      page.tsx (if needed)
    contact/
      page.tsx (if needed)
    layout.tsx (updated)
```

**Props Interface:**
```typescript
interface FooterProps {
  companyName?: string;
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- Next.js Link component
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest + React Testing Library (already configured)
- No additional libraries required

**Test Categories:**
```typescript
// Unit Tests (15+ tests)
describe('Footer Component', () => {
  describe('Rendering', () => {
    // Component renders without errors
    // Displays all required elements
    // Handles props correctly
  })
  
  describe('Navigation Links', () => {
    // Home link has correct href
    // About link has correct href  
    // Contact link has correct href
    // Links have proper accessibility attributes
  })
  
  describe('Copyright', () => {
    // Shows current year dynamically
    // Displays default company name
    // Shows custom company name when provided
  })
  
  describe('Layout & Styling', () => {
    // Has correct CSS classes for layout
    // Responsive classes are applied
    // Hover effects work properly
  })
})
```

## Future Considerations

- Social media links could be added later
- Newsletter signup integration
- Additional legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms)
- Footer customization for different sections of the site
