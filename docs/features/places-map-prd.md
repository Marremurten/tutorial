# Places Map Feature - PRD

## Overview
Display an interactive map of Stockholm showing the location of places added to the database with filtering and detailed view capabilities.

## Feature Description
An interactive map component that visualizes all places from the database on a map of Stockholm, allowing users to explore locations geographically and access detailed information about each place.

## User Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive Map Display**: Show an interactive map centered on greater Stockholm area
- **Place Markers**: Display all places from the database as markers on the map
- **Map Navigation**: Users can zoom in/out and pan around the map
- **Marker Interaction**: Click on place markers to view detailed information
- **Category Filtering**: Filter visible places by categories using checkboxes
- **Multi-Selection**: Allow multiple categories to be selected simultaneously

### User Interactions
1. **Map Navigation**
   - Zoom in/out using mouse wheel or zoom controls
   - Pan around the map by dragging
   - Default view shows greater Stockholm area

2. **Place Discovery**
   - View all places as markers on the map
   - Click on any marker to view place details
   - Filter places by category using checkbox controls

3. **Detailed View**
   - Right sidebar opens when clicking on a place marker
   - Display full detailed information about the selected place
   - Sidebar can be closed to return to map-only view

### Technical Requirements
- **Map Service**: Integrate with Google Maps API (already configured in project)
- **Data Source**: Fetch places from existing MongoDB database via API routes
- **Geographic Bounds**: Default map view covers greater Stockholm area
- **Responsive Design**: Map and sidebar work on different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Efficiently handle multiple markers on the map
- **Fallback Coordinates**: If a place is missing latitude/longitude coordinates, use Stockholm center coordinates (59.3293, 18.0686) and randomize position within close proximity to central Stockholm

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to see all places on a map so I can understand their geographic distribution
2. As a user, I want to filter places by category so I can find specific types of locations
3. As a user, I want to click on a marker to see detailed information about a place
4. As a user, I want to navigate the map freely to explore different areas of Stockholm
5. As a user, I want the map to load showing the greater Stockholm area as default

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interactive map displays centered on greater Stockholm
- [ ] All database places appear as markers on the map
- [ ] Users can zoom and pan the map smoothly
- [ ] Clicking a marker opens a right sidebar with full place details
- [ ] Category filter checkboxes allow multiple selections
- [ ] Filtered results update markers on map in real-time
- [ ] Map is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- [ ] Loading states are handled gracefully

## Implementation Notes
- Reuse existing Google Maps API configuration
- Leverage existing Place model and API routes
- Consider marker clustering for performance with many places
- Implement proper error handling for map loading failures
- Ensure accessibility standards for map and sidebar interactions
- Implement coordinate fallback logic: generate random coordinates within ~1km radius of Stockholm center for places missing lat/lng data
